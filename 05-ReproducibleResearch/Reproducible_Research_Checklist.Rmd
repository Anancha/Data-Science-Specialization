Reproducible Research Checklist
===============================


* Are we doing good science?

* Was any part of this analysis done by hand?

>       if so, are those parts *precisely* documnet?
>       Dose the documentation match reality?

* Have we taught a computer to do as much as possible (i.e. coded)?

* Are we using a version controal system?

* Have we documneted our software environment?

* Have we saved any output that we cannot reconstruct from original data + code?

* How far back in the analysis pipeline can we go before our results are no longer (automatically) reproducible?
